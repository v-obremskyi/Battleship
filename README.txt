1. Game starts, and creates one DotCom and gives it a location on three cells in the single row of seven cells.
2. Game play begins. Prompt user for a guess, then check to see if it hit any of the DotCom's three cells. 
   If a hit, increment the numOfHits variable.
3. Game finishes when all three cells have been hit (the numOfHits variable value is 3), and tells the user how many guesses 
   it took to sink the DotCom.
